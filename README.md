# Installation

The recommended installation is done via the prepackaged releases available at [Fronted/releases](https://github.com/Chaostheorie/Penta-Tournament-Frontend/releases).

We recommend changing the preferences.json in the installation directory to your own settings e.g. the location of your Backend server. At the moment we only provide access to a free heroku dyno running the latest development version, which is sometimes broken, because it's build from the [Penta-Tournament-Backend/Backend](https://github.com/Chaostheorie/Penta-Tournament-Backend) repository.

# Installation for contributing/ development

Will be available soon.
